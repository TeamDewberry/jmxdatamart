The extraction process maintains statistics about itself in an MBean.  Through this MBean you can get
   * The total number of times that extraction has occurred
   * The total amount of time (in milliseconds) that the extractor has spent extracting statistics
   * The total number of bytes that have been written to a data file
   * The number of MBean attributes that were harvested in a given extraction

You can also perform the following operations via the MBean
   * Extract MBean values to the statistics file
      * This would be helpful if the user wants to extract MBeans on demand (at the end of a test run, for instance, instead of periodically)
   * Reload the extractor's configuration file
      * This might be helpful to tests (like these !FitNesse tests)

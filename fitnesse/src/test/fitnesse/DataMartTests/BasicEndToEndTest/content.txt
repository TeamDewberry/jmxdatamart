This test verifies an end-to-end extract and load of JMX Statistics into the Data Mart.

First we set up a simple JMX MBean with one attribute.


Then we configure the collector
   * What beans should it collect?
   * How often should it collect them?
   * Where should it write the statistics file?


Then we give the collector some time to do its thing

collect statistics for 5 seconds

Then we load the statistics file into the data mart

Finally, we verify that the statistics were loaded as expected
